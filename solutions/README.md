# Solutions to problems

This directory contains solutions to competitive programming problems from
various websites.

## Structure

Each subdirectory contains solutions for the given website. Where applicable,
the directories are further divided into:

- "Contests," which store solutions coded up live during contests, which are
  therfore more likely to be incomplete or overcomplicated.
- "Random Problems," which store solutions coded up offline and are more likely
  to be readable and almost certainly pass (there's a few unfished solutions,
  but >95% should be good).

## Implementation

Note that many solutions use the copy-pasted library functions from the
[library](https://github.com/matt-rymar/competitive-programming/tree/main/library).
